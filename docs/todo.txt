Todo for fbl3:

-----

ImGui - working great! in more progress..
gaia ecs - working great! in more progress..

Sprite sorting - not a problem

-----

Think about how systems should work (1 system per quirk? no..)

-----

Think about all other systems (character creation, recruit, drg, record, summarize)
Biorythm :)

-----

Think about how to structure game-events:

- 1 Lua script / 10 years in game
- handful of c++ functions to call (sol?)
- build dynamic gui + image + text

-----

To think about regarding gaia ecs:

leverage da powa!

- queries
- use the turn off/on on entities and systems
- use world.update()

make helper functions for ex. initiating entities

Make a bulletproof serializer! So you can save and load complete
game state anywhere anytime (keep all game data in component arrays)

Rename/move folders:
engine->Engine
game->Game
vendor->vs should be vendor->lib->vs (and contain the lib files only.)
SDL3 headers should be in vendor->include->SDL3 (rename common to include as all includes are common)
